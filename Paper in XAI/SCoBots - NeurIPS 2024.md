## Summary of "Interpretable Concept Bottlenecks to Align Reinforcement Learning Agents"

This paper introduces **Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents (SCoBots)**, a novel architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents designed to be inherently interpretable and alignable with human intentions. The authors tackle critical issues in modern Deep RL, such as the "black-box" nature of agents, reward sparsity, and, most notably, **goal misalignment**, where agents learn unintended "shortcut" strategies.

The core contribution is an agent that reasons not just over object properties but also over explicit **relational concepts** between objects, enabling a transparent decision-making process that can be inspected and corrected by human experts.

### The Core Problem: A Surprising Discovery in Pong 🕹️

A key finding that motivates this work is the discovery of a previously unknown misalignment problem in the classic Atari game,

**Pong**. The authors found that standard Deep RL agents do not learn the intended strategy of tracking the ball. Instead, they learn a shortcut: **tracking the opponent's paddle**.

This works during training because the opponent's paddle is programmed to follow the ball, creating a strong spurious correlation. However, this shortcut leads to catastrophic failure when the environment is slightly modified, for example, by making the opponent invisible (**NoEnemy** environment). This discovery highlights the severe risks of deploying black-box agents and the limitations of post-hoc explanation methods (like importance maps), which failed to clearly identify this issue.

### The SCoBots Architecture 🏗️

SCoBots decompose the standard end-to-end policy ($s_t \rightarrow a_t$) into a sequence of three interpretable steps:

1.  **Object Extractor (ω)**:
    
	- **Function**: This initial bottleneck processes raw environment states (e.g., image frames) and outputs a set of symbolic **object representations** (Ωt​)6.
        
    - **Structure**: In the paper, this is implemented using **[OCAtari](https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari)**, a tool that uses RAM reverse-engineering to extract near-perfect object information7777. In a general case, this could be a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
        
    - **Output**: A structured list of objects like `ball`, `player`, and `enemy`, along with their properties (e.g., x, y coordinates, color)8.
        
2. **Relation Extractor (μ)**:
    
    - **Function**: This is the paper's key innovation. This second bottleneck takes the object representations ($\Omega_t$​) and applies a predefined set of transparent functions (F) to compute **relational concepts** ($\Gamma_t$).
        
    - **Structure**: This is not a neural network but a collection of **hard-coded formulas**, such as `distance(obj1, obj2)`, `speed(obj)`, etc. It is fully transparent and does not involve learning.
        
    - **Output**: A feature vector where each element represents a meaningful relationship, like `distance(player, ball).x` or `speed(ball).y`.
        
3. **Action Selector (ρ)**:
    
    - **Function**: This final component takes the relational concept vector ($\Gamma_t$) as input and selects the best action ($a_t$).
        
    - **Structure**: To maintain interpretability, the authors use a two-step process. First, they train a small ReLU-based **neural network** (an `MlpPolicy` trained via PPO) for high performance. Afterwards, this trained network is **distilled** into a **Decision Tree**.
        
    - **Output**: The final policy is a set of human-readable IF-THEN rules (e.g., "IF `dist(player, flag).x > 15` THEN move `RIGHT`")15. The distillation into a decision tree is performed using algorithms like **[VIPER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07021).** Access the .md file at [[VIPER - NeurIPS 2018]]

### Key Innovations and Strengths ✨

SCoBots introduce several advantages over standard RL agents:

- **Interpretability by Design**: Unlike post-hoc **[Explainable AI (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)** methods that try to explain a black-box model, SCoBots are a "glass-box" by design. The decision path—from objects to relations to rules—is fully transparent. This approach is a practical example of **[Neuro-Symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI)**, combining learned representations with symbolic reasoning.
    
- **Human-in-the-Loop Interaction**: The transparent bottlenecks allow for direct human intervention to guide and correct the agent's behavior. The paper demonstrates two powerful techniques:
    
    1. **Concept Pruning**: Experts can remove irrelevant or misleading concepts (objects, properties, or relations) by editing a configuration file (`focus file`)17. This was used to fix the Pong misalignment by simply removing the "enemy" object, forcing the agent to learn based on the ball's position18.
        
    2. **Object-Centric Reward Shaping**: Because the agent reasons over meaningful concepts, humans can easily design targeted reward signals to fix flawed behaviors19. This was used to solve the ill-defined reward problem in
        
        **Kangaroo** (rewarding proximity to the joey) and the credit assignment problem in **Skiing** (rewarding speed and proximity to flags)20202020.

### Experimental Results 📊

The experiments were designed to validate the SCoBots approach across several dimensions:

- **Competitive Performance**: On 9 different Atari games, SCoBots achieved performance on par with, or even slightly better than, standard Deep RL baselines, demonstrating that interpretability does not have to come at a significant cost to performance21.
    
- **Effective Misalignment Correction**: The experiments on the modified Pong environments conclusively showed that SCoBots could not only detect the shortcut behavior but also easily correct it through concept pruning, achieving high scores where standard agents failed completely22.
    
- **Robustness**: Ablation studies showed that the agents could maintain performance even with imperfect (noisy) object extractors23. They also confirmed that the explicit relation extractor (
    
    μ) was crucial for the performance and interpretability of the final decision tree policy24.

### Limitations and Future Work

The authors acknowledge several limitations:

- **Reliance on Object Extractors**: The method's effectiveness heavily depends on having a capable object extractor (ω). The paper uses a near-perfect tool (OCAtari), but in real-world scenarios, learning this component from pixels is a significant challenge25252525.
    
- **Manual Definition of Relations**: The set of relational functions (F) is manually defined by humans, which may not scale to more complex environments where the relevant relations are not obvious26.
    
- **Scope of Concepts**: The current framework is object-centric and may not be sufficient for environments requiring other types of abstract reasoning, such as navigating a maze in _MsPacman_27.

### Conclusion

SCoBots represent an important step towards building more transparent, trustworthy, and aligned **[Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)** agents. By structuring the agent's reasoning process around human-understandable concepts and their relationships, the framework not only achieves competitive performance but also empowers human experts to diagnose and remedy critical flaws like goal misalignment, paving the way for safer and more reliable AI systems.
